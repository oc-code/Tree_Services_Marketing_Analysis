# Tree_Services_Marketing_Analysis

An anonymous company located in Long Island, NY, provides professional tree services, such as pruning,
trimming, removal, tree disease diagnosis, and plant healthcare services. In this study, I am trying
to provide digital marketing campaign strategies for new homeowner in yard market in Long Island by 
understanding the company's existing customer pool and identifying the market potential.

*** Special thanks Michael Monzillo for working with me and resolved the GIS problem which is finding 
the middle point between a predetermined set of zip codes of interest, and determining a marketing radius 
which will include all of those zipcodes using US Census Bureau geographic data and geospatial operations.
