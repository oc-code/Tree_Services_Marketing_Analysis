# Tree_Services_Marketing_Analysis

An anonymous company located in Long Island, NY, provides professional tree services, such as pruning,
trimming, removal, tree disease diagnosis, and plant healthcare services. In this study, I am trying
to provide digital marketing campaign strategies for new homeowner in yard market in Long Island by 
understanding the company's existing customer pool and identifying the market potential.

*** Special thanks to Michael Monzillo for walking me through the GIS problem (see target location 
distribution map and further study) using sf and tigris libraries to find the center point between 
a predetermined set of zip codes of interest, and determining a marketing radius which will include 
all of those zipcodes using US Census Bureau geographic data and geospatial operations.
